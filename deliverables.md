# Deliverables

## 1) Qualification Phase

For the qualification phase, each participating team must upload **a written report** to the [HotCRP system](https://hotcrp.engineering.nyu.edu/) in PDF file format following the standard IEEE conference format (10pt font, double column, letter size paper, not compsoc mode); templates are available [here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (LaTeX template is preferred). The qualification phase PDF report can be **up to 4 pages**, including references and appendices.

## 2) Final Phase

For the final phase, each participating team must upload **a final report** to
the [HotCRP system](https://hotcrp.engineering.nyu.edu/) in PDF file format
following the standard IEEE conference format (10pt font, double column, letter
size paper, not compsoc mode); templates are available
[here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
(LaTeX template is preferred). The final phase PDF report can be **up to 10
pages** including references and appendices.

In addition, teams should upload additional materials for each challenge as
indicated in the corresponding challenge description in a zip file to HotCRP. In
the event that the file is too large, upload a link to a private Google Drive or
similar service and provide access only to the challenge organizers.

Lastly, teams should **create a poster and a 10-minute powerpoint presentation
to be in-person**
for the live finals that take place on November 9-12. Teams should bring their printed poster to the finals.

The report, powerpoint and poster presentations should include a description of your
setup and tools that you used, a brief overview of the challenges and a detailed 
account of how you solved the challenges. Where relevant, please provide the 
number of queries and neural network accuracy for your attacks and mitigations. 
The report is expected to provide details an all challenges. The powerpoint and poster 
can focus on a subset of challenges that best show your ingeinuity.
