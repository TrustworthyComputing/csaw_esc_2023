### Sock and Roll

In the heart of the whimsical and colorful Happy Socks factory, you find yourselves caught in a captivating and slightly bizarre world. This factory is a maze of vibrant rooms filled with the magic of sock-making machines, piles of socks adorned in all shades and patterns, and, of course, the joyful, dancing sock mascots that are the emblem of this fantastical place. However, what was initially a delightful visit has turned into an unexpected challenge. You have been mysteriously locked inside one of the factory's rooms, with no apparent way out. The laughter and cheerfulness of the factory have given way to a sense of urgency as you realize they need to escape. Luckily, you find the Happy Tap Dancing Socks Message Machine 2000, which seems to be transmitting some strange message. The only way to exit this colorful world and return to reality is to send an SOS signal using this cutting-edge messaging technology.

### Vender Bender

You roll up to that there vending machine, and it's making a soft hum, like a well-tuned engine, promising you a sweet snack for your taste buds. You eyeball the colorful snacks, deciding if you want them chips for a salty crunch or that chocolate bar for a sweet fix. You've got some coins clinking in your hand, ready to drop 'em in and get that engine running. You pause, and think if there is a better way... a free way. Maybe if you trigger an error before the snack is dispensed, you can get your money back? Can you pump the brakes when your hear the gears whirring, and make off with your snack like it's a freshly greased wrench? Then lets take those taste buds on a delicious test drive.
